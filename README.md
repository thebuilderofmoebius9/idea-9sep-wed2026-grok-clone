# BotWorkspace

## Linux fork

This fork now includes a runnable Linux workspace in [`LinuxWorkspace`](LinuxWorkspace).
It is a local Node/browser application with no third-party packages: bots, groups,
drafts, attachments, routines, exports and streamed replies from OpenAI-compatible
endpoints, with session-only credentials and a review-then-confirm send flow; see the
[Linux port boundary](docs/LINUX-PORT.md). The original SwiftUI/AppKit app below
remains the macOS reference implementation.

An independent, open-source native macOS workspace for named AI teammates.
Built with **SwiftUI, AppKit and Core Data**, using only Apple frameworks.
The repository name preserves its original [grok-clone idea capsule](PROPOSAL.md).

**Experimental source release, not a finished AI client.** Bots, groups, drafts
and routines persist locally. Native provider settings, streamed replies,
ordered group rounds, Stop and Retry are wired to the provider core and tested
with offline fixtures. An experimental, fixed-origin Codex text adapter accepts an explicitly imported
ChatGPT `auth.json` for this session only. Real Keychain/signing and broad provider
compatibility remain open. No Grok Bot/Cursor service, subscription,
remote computer or private API is included; this project is not affiliated with them.

## Run the local app

```sh
scripts/native-app.sh run
scripts/native-app.sh test
scripts/native-app.sh smoke
scripts/native-app.sh provider-smoke # offline fixture; no key or live network
scripts/native-app.sh codex-smoke    # synthetic auth + intercepted Responses SSE
scripts/native-app.sh profile-smoke  # bot edit + group edit + close/reopen
scripts/native-app.sh unread-smoke # persisted previews/counts + foreground-only read acknowledgement
scripts/native-app.sh appearance-smoke # isolated Dark/Light/System + persistent pane preferences
scripts/native-app.sh attachment-smoke # synthetic selected files + consent + offline send
scripts/native-app.sh group-smoke    # ordered recipients + round consent + offline replies
scripts/native-app.sh mention-smoke  # draft mentions + identity-safe consent + offline replies
scripts/native-app.sh reply-smoke    # reply draft restart + referenced fixture send
scripts/native-app.sh export-smoke   # JSON export + atomic file replacement (text fixture)
scripts/native-app.sh deletion-smoke # confirmed bot deletion + retained group/restart
scripts/native-app.sh routine-smoke  # daily editor + offline run + pause/resume/history restart
```

The `.app` is built at `Prototypes/NativeShell/.build/BotWorkspace.app`. It opens an empty workspace on first use and keeps data inside its macOS sandbox. **No provider is configured by default.** Settings offers Z.ai general API, local 9router, OpenAI Platform and custom setup templates. A separate **Codex login (experimental)** provider type imports a user-selected auth JSON into memory only; it is not an OpenAI Platform API key. Enter the endpoint/model/key for compatible providers, then select the provider and (for groups) one or more replying bots in the composer. Multiple recipients require review of the ordered round and its separate requests. Without a usable credential, the draft is retained.

Protected Keychain access requires authorized signing. For an ad-hoc local build, explicitly choose **This session only** to keep the key in process memory until quitting; re-enter it on the next launch. There is no automatic fallback or plaintext credential file. See [provider setup](docs/PROVIDER-SETUP.md) and [integration/signing limits](docs/PROVIDER-CORE.md).

## Try the native prototype

```sh
scripts/native-prototype.sh run
scripts/native-prototype.sh test
```

Requires macOS and the Xcode Swift 6 toolchain. Deployment target: macOS 14+;
runtime verification so far: macOS 26.5.1 on Apple Silicon, Xcode 26.6.
Builds are locally ad-hoc signed, not notarized release binaries. No API key or
third-party dependency installation is needed for the current app or tests.

## What works

| Area | Current status |
|---|---|
| Appearance/layout | Saved Dark/Light/System, Save/Cancel settings, persistent pane widths/visibility, minimum-width chat protection |
| Native UI | Persisted sidebar previews/timestamps/unread reply badges, three-pane workspace, bot/group creation and profile editing, search, hide/show, confirmed bot deletion/group repair, native text composer, message replies |
| Local data | Core Data v4 with tested v1/v2/v3 migration, text/reply drafts, message pagination, routine ledger, JSON export v3 including stored attachment bytes |
| Provider integration | Native Settings, endpoint/model selection, attributed streamed text, queue, Stop/Retry; offline-fixture tested |
| Group rounds | Ordered explicit recipients, one user message, per-member attributed replies, aggregate consent and Stop remaining round; typed/menu mentions with identity-safe targeting |
| Credentials | API keys: protected Keychain or explicit session memory. Codex login: explicit file import, memory-only, fixed host, no refresh. Authorized signing/Keychain still unverified |
| Routines | Native interval/daily editor, explicit owner/provider consent, Run Now, pause/resume, Stop/delete and history; launch/wake/30-second awake scheduling, offline tested |
| Text attachments | Native file picker, persistent/removable chips, atomic managed copies and per-send file/destination confirmation; no images |
| Remaining gates | Broad provider/9router validation, real file-picker sandbox grants and remaining native accessibility flows |

Verification: **564 tests** (300 core + 264 shell), desktop/narrow native persistence,
offline provider, mention-routing and ordered group-round smokes, aggregate-consent/round-cancellation tests, profile-edit and reply close/reopen smokes, attachment storage/migration, importer and explicit-consent guards, text-fixture export, confirmed deletion and routine editor/run/restart smokes, appearance/pane preference tests and light/dark minimum-window rendering, Settings rendering, build/signature and formatting checks. See [reply workflow](docs/REPLY-WORKFLOW.md) and the evidence
and limitations below for the current test counts and scope. An explicitly authorized
manual native Codex check also completed a minimal reply with persistence and
attribution; one account/time is not broad compatibility or release certification.
